# Satellite Image Classification

This is my work for the satellite image classification kaggle competition for **GNR-638 Machine Learning for Remote Sensing II** course. 

The classifier takes an input image and outputs a label belonging to one of the following classes:

1 - Basketball court  
2 - Beach  
3 - Forest  
4 - Railway  
5 - Tennis court  
6 - Water pool  
7 - Others
